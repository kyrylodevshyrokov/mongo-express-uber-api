# Uber API

## About

This is a convenient API, a prototype of Uber, that allows you to manage drivers and perform a full range of CRUD operations on drivers. It also tests each of these operations.

## Features

- Each user can create, update, or delete a driver.
- Each user can find a driver within an allowable radius around them.

## Technologies

- MongoDB: a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program.
- Mongoose: a JavaScript object-oriented programming library that creates a connection between MongoDB and the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment.
- Express: a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- Mocha: a JavaScript test framework for Node.js programs, featuring browser support, asynchronous testing, test coverage reports, and use of any assertion library.
